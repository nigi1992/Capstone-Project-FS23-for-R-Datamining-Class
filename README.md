My Capstone Project for the FS23 Data mining in R Class


**"StandplÃ¤tze, Durchgangs- und TransitplÃ¤tze fÃ¼r Jenische, Sinti und Roma"**

## Data ðŸ—ƒ
I used data from Opendata.swiss from the URL: https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/standplatze-durchgangs-und-transitplatze-fur-jenische-sinti-und-roma. Let me know, if you want the raw data.
The Input data is in the main repo, saved as "halteplaetze-jenische_sinti_roma_2056.xlsx" and "halteplaetze-jenische_sinti_roma_2056.csv".
The Output data is in the "Output Data" Folder.

## Scripts ðŸ’»
You'll find my scripts in the folder Â«scriptsÂ».
"Reset Git.R" is for Github Repo Setup.
"API Setup.R" is for attempting to extract and parse the API of opendata.swiss.
"Data Preparation.R" contains code regarding the preparation of the raw data.
"Spatial Analysis.R" is where I conducted the spatial analysis and plotted some initial figures.
"Descriptive Stats.R" contains code for some basic Stats.
"Data Visualization.R" contains the plotted maps of Switzerland with the data integrated.
"Faulty Code Appendix + Suggestions.R" contains rest code + faulty code.
"Notes.R" some personal notes.

## Figures ðŸš€
You'll find my plotted figures and maps in the folder Â«ImagesÂ». 

## R Markdown
The R Markdown is saved as "Report.Rmd" in the "Report" folder.
There you'll also find it as a HTML file under "report.html"
Please consult the R Markdown document though, as it contains code chuncks that display the generated plots and data.
