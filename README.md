## Scripts ðŸ’»
You'll find my scripts in the folder Â«scriptsÂ».
"Reset Git.R" is for Github Repo Setup.
"API Setup.R" is for attempting to extract and parse the API of geocat.
"Data Preparation.R" contains code regarding the preparation of the raw data.
"Spatial Analysis.R" is where I conducted the spatial analysis and plotted some initial figures.
"Descriptive Stats.R" contains code for some basic Stats.
"Data Visualization.R" contains the plotted maps of Switzerland with the data integrated.
"Faulty Code Appendix + Suggestions.R" contains rest code + faulty code.
"Notes.R" some personal notes.
